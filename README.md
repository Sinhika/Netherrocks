# Netherrocks

Repository for Netherrocks add-on for Simple Ores2 by AleXndrTheGr8st, maintained by Sinhika

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code 
<https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod> that he made free to all to borrow, 
in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in
Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it. 


TO DO
-----
* update/move wiki 
* Decide if we really need more detailed configs than that.
* Add shears for all metals.
* <s>Add dusts for all ores.</s>
* <s>add support for Silent's Mechanisms: Crusher</s>
* <s>add support for Silent Gear</s>
* <s>add random chance for injected loot, instead of 100% guaranteed.</s>
* <s>Malachite weapons should be mildly poisonous.</s>
